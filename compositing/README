This program is written in Common Lisp, and uses LTK as the display engine.

It does require that SBCL be used as the compiler.

It can be compiled with the make command, however, I have not packaged LTK
with it. LTK was slightly modified by me, with the following function added
to ltk.lisp:

;; Extension - put data in an image
;; Galen M. Helfter
(defun image-writedata (image data)
  (format-wish "~A put \"~a\"" (name image) data))

And the following added to the module declaration:

image-writedata

To not duplicate code, the PNG image reading code is also located higher up
in the repository, and only the modified Makefile is placed here.

Thus, to build this project, the .c and .h files from my image_load code
must be placed in the image_load directory, and the files for ltk must
be placed in the ltk directory. The project should then compile and run.
