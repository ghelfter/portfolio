This project was original done during my undergraduate, as a research project
with the school of computing for the Calhoun Honors College. In this project,
we researched procedural eye and eye blink animations. I programmed all of the
following script which, given a set of blinks, applied the appropriate
function and keyframed it in Maya.

This script expects that it is to be run using Maya's python engine. This
version was crafted for a DPA production studio course, and thus has
removed all of the combined code written by others that detected and analyzed
eye tracking information. It only includes the blink application code, but can
be used (as it was for the production), to take a list of times where we might
want to apply the blink and procedurally animate them. It currently also
uses some quickly hacked retargets to change the expected zero to one output
and transform it to what was needed for the controller, as the rig for the
production was not produced with this in mind.
